# Volt
Volt is a solar tracker designed to assist users in finding the optimal location for harnessing solar energy. By leveraging advanced algorithms, Volt helps users identify the best positions for maximizing sunlight exposure and enhancing energy production.

## Installation

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the Volt repository from GitHub. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asan1900/volt
```

Navigate to the Volt Directory: Change your current working directory to the Volt project folder using the following command:

## Run Volt: 
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can launch Volt by executing the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Volt will start running and provide you with the final result for the Almaty location. You can then utilize this information to optimize your solar energy generation and contribute to a greener world.

Remember to customize the location settings within the main.py file to suit your specific requirements. You can modify the latitude, longitude, and other parameters to explore different regions and evaluate their solar energy potential.

Harness the power of Volt and make a positive impact by utilizing renewable energy resources effectively. Together, let's create a cleaner and more sustainable future.
